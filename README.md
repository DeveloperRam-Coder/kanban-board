# kanban-board

To design a Kanban Board in Vue.js with a solid tech stack, we can break it down into various steps. Below is a comprehensive README file for the project, which covers setting up the project, its structure, and the technologies you'll use.

# Kanban Board in Vue.js

## Project Overview

This project is a Kanban board application built using **Vue.js** and **Vuex** for state management. The application allows users to create, move, and delete tasks in different columns (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done). It includes authentication (via Firebase), local storage for persistence, and an intuitive user interface for managing tasks.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - Vue.js: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
  - Vuex: State management for handling the application's data.
  - Vuetify: UI component library to create a beautiful, responsive design.
  - Firebase: For authentication and cloud-based data storage.

- **Backend (Optional):**
  - Firebase (Firestore) to persist tasks and user data.
  
- **Development Tools:**
  - Vue CLI: For scaffolding the Vue.js application.
  - ESLint: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
  - Prettier: Code formatter for consistent formatting.

---

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add tasks to the Kanban board.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns (To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Authentication**: User sign-up and login functionality using Firebase.
- **Persistence**: Store tasks and user data in Firebase.
- **Task Management**: Edit, delete, and update task details.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach to ensure the board is usable on all screen sizes.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanban-board-vuejs.git
cd kanban-board-vuejs
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using **npm** or **yarn**:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

- Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Add Firebase credentials to the `.env` file:

```plaintext
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VUE_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 4. Run the Application

After installing dependencies and setting up Firebase, you can run the application locally:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Components Overview

- **Board.vue**: The main container for the Kanban board, displaying the columns.
- **Task.vue**: Represents a task that can be dragged and dropped.
- **Login.vue**: Login page for user authentication.
- **Register.vue**: Register page for new users.
- **Navbar.vue**: A navigation bar to manage login/logout and direct users to different pages.

---

## Vuex Store Structure

- **State**: Manages the application's data, such as tasks, user information, etc.
- **Mutations**: Methods to modify the state directly.
- **Actions**: Asynchronous methods to fetch data or perform tasks.
- **Getters**: Functions to get data from the state.

```javascript
// src/store/index.js
export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    tasks: [],
    user: null,
  },
  mutations: {
    setTasks(state, tasks) {
      state.tasks = tasks;
    },
    setUser(state, user) {
      state.user = user;
    },
  },
  actions: {
    fetchTasks({ commit }) {
      // Fetch tasks from Firebase
    },
    registerUser({ commit }, user) {
      // Register user in Firebase
    },
  },
  getters: {
    getTasks: (state) => state.tasks,
    getUser: (state) => state.user,
  },
});
```

---

## Firebase Authentication

- **Login**: Users can log in using Firebase Authentication.
- **Register**: New users can register for an account using email and password.
- **Persist Login**: Firebase automatically persists the login state across page reloads.
